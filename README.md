# ModuleManager

A simple Node.js based web app for managing the installed Thecus modules on Thecus N2520 NAS.

This module will list all installed Thecus modules so you can stop/start/restart them as you want.

# Usage
This source code is based on Thecus OS6 SDK ([1.03](http://ftp.thecus.com/download/app/development_files/mk_module_1.0.3_for_OS6.tar.gz)) and already contains everything you need to build a simple node.js based module for Thecus NAS. Simply run

      create_module.sh

The module file will be output at target folder.

# About the Node.js app
Since N2520 came with Node.js 0.8 and forever already, this simple module did not contain a copy of node.js binary. The actual web app are located under

      /Binary/Web_UI
